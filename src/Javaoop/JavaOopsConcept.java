  /* Method VS Constructor
        Method:
        1. Method name can be anything/Methods name must be different from the class name
        2. Method may or may not return a value
        3. If method is not returning any value then specify VOID
        4. Method can take parameters/arguments
        5. We have to invoke/call methods explicitly through object
        6. Used for logical concept/implement logic
        Constructor:
        1. Constructor name must be the same as class name
        2. Constructor will never return any value
        3. We are not allowed to specify the VOID
        4. Constructor can take parameters/arguments
        5. Constructor automatically invoked at the time of object creation
        6. Used for initializing/assigning values of the variables */
